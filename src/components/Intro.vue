            <p>
                I'm a 3rd year student at SFU majoring in Computer Science. When I was in high school, I learned how to code and fell in love with it.
                5 years later, my passion for coding hasn't faded. I constantly find cool and challenging projects that exceed my current ability and
                work on them
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I'm working at Article as a Full stack developer co-op
